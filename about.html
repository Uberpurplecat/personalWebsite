    <h2 class="text">Cross Country<br>A couple years back I had a real passion for running. I started
        cross country in 2015 and fell in love with it mostly because of where running can just take you.
        Its a great sport for when you need to think by yourself or just love the to see the sunrise.
        I have participated in 10, 5 kilometer races (3 Miles) and in one half marathone. I am aiming for more</h2>

        <h3 class="text">Video Games<br>I play some video games on the side but mostly league of legends. I try to keep it at a 
            minimum mostly because I want to be able to do other things but overwall its a way to relax and just play for
            a couple of hours with friends. Other games I love to play are World of warcraft, battfield 1, and starcraft</h3>

    <h4 class="text">Gym<br>As I mentioned that I was in cross country. I have slowed down on the running and been trying to gain weigth 
        because I have been skinny all of my life. The gym again really helps with the mental health of a person and also lets 
        me not feel bad about whatever I want to eat.</h4>
